# I can't think of anything that needs to go in here at the moment. Maybe if we
# add an inventory system to every chest we will need this. But as it stands, we
# don't have any other things that we will interact with at the moment, and chests
# give out an item we select and a number of that item. So there isn't really
# anything to overwrite.
